This is my submission for the python-api-challenge. I utilized the cartopy, geoviews, and pyproj libraries for the map generation in the vacation portion of the assignment. ChatGPT was utilized for the map generation portion and for cleaning up naming in code, particularly with the linear regression portion of the weather section of the assignment.
